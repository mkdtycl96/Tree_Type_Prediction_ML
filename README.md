# Tree Type Prediction ML Project-

1-) Welcome to "**Tree Types Prediction Project**".

In this project, you must apply EDA processes for the development of predictive models. Handling outliers, domain knowledge and feature engineering (using sqlite3 library) will be challenges.

Also, this project aims to improve your ability to implement algorithms for Multi-Class Classification. Thus, you will have the opportunity to implement many algorithms commonly used for Multi-Class Classification problems.

Before diving into the project, please take a look at the determines and tasks.

   **NOTE**: This project assumes that you already know the basics of coding in Python. You should also be familiar with the theory behind classification models and scikit-learn        module as well as Machine Learning before you begin.

**2-)** We deal with tree type dataset in this notebook.
       
       **first** We loaded the dataset and explored it. order to understand the data . We Focus
